CustomizeIt is an app that lets users select a product from a list (each with a name, image, and description) and customize it by choosing from a variety of property typesâ€”checkboxes, radio buttons, or freetext inputs. Each property can include optional images and descriptions, be marked as mandatory, and have additional pricing logic (e.g., cost per letter or tiered pricing). Radio button properties are always required with one pre-selected option, while checkbox and freetext types offer more flexibility.

After customization, users can review the final product with all selected options and costs, then proceed to enter their delivery address and choose a postal method for shipping. The app is structured to support a modular backend for product data and a frontend that guides users smoothly through selection, customization, and order placement.
